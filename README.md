# Naming Poetics in Middle High German Epic

This project provides an interactive analysis tool for examining the use of names and naming variants (proper names, antonomasia, and epithets) in Middle High German epic literature. It was developed in the context of the doctoral dissertation **"Naming Poetics in Middle High German Epic"** (Linda Beutel, University of Salzburg).

The goal is to use an XML-TEI encoded corpus and an Excel worksheet to:

- automatically detect new name variants,
- interactively verify and categorize them,
- record their collocational context,
- and export and analyze the structured results.
